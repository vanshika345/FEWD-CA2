GAME: FLUFFY BIRD

Welcome to Fluffy Bird, a simple yet challenging game that I created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is my first-ever game, and I'm excited to share it with you!

#How to Play:
Objective: Guide the fluffy bird through the pipes without touching them or the top/bottom of the screen.

Controls: press spacebar to ascend. Be careful, as tapping too much or too little might lead to a collision!

Scoring: Your score is determined by the number of pipes you successfully navigate through.

Nickname: Enter your nickname at the beginning, and it will be stored using local storage.

End of Game: Your final score and nickname will be displayed at the end of the game. Watch out for some random phrases that will pop up along with your results!

#Features:
Local Storage: Your nickname and high score will be displayed at the Out screen.

Responsive Design: Fluffy Bird is optimized for both mobile (360 x 800) and laptop (1920 x 1080) dimensions, ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience on various devices.

#Technical Details:
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Storage: Local storage is utilized to store and retrieve the player's nickname and high score.

#Acknowledgments and credit:
I would like to express my gratitude to the developers of the Flappy Bird game, which inspired this project.
